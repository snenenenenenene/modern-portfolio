            Hey there! I just wanted to share with you something I&apos;m really
            proud of - I created multiple portfolio websites throughout my time
            in university and work.
            <br />
            <br /> My first website was a modern one built with NextJS. I wanted
            to keep it simple and professional, showcasing my work and
            achievements in a clean and easy-to-navigate design.
            <br />

                <p> 2021-2023</p>
              </span>
              <span className="flex flex-col ml-20">
                <p>ROLE</p>
                <p>Development</p>
              </span>
              <span className="flex flex-col justify-end ml-auto">

                  href="https://www.sennebels.xyz"
                  className="underline-offset-2"

                </a>
              </span>
            </section>
            <br /> For my next website, I was inspired by the 20s art style of
            Cuphead, so I decided to create a website in that style using React.
            I wanted to show off my creativity and have some fun with the
            design, while still maintaining a professional edge.
            <br />

            The third website I made features a 3D model of a room, created
            using ThreeJS and GSAP. I was really interested in 3D modeling and
            animation, so I wanted to incorporate that into my portfolio.
            I&apos;m really proud of how this one turned out - it&apos;s a great
            showcase of my skills and my passion for the craft.

            Finally, my latest website is another 3D one, but this time it
            features a ramen shop with sound effects. I wanted to create an
            immersive experience for visitors, and I thought sound effects would
            really enhance the overall feel of the website.

            I&apos;m really proud of the fact that I was able to create multiple
            websites with different themes and styles. It shows that I&apos;m
            versatile and able to adapt to different technologies and design
            trends. I&apos;m excited to keep learning and growing in this field
            and see what other projects I can tackle in the future!
